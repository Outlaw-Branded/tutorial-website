                        For the purpose of these tutorials i have highlighted the tab and important sections of the page, Ive already made an error on this first one and highlighted Save Guild and Save Slot which you dont need to mess with. Main thing that we are going to cover on this page is the platform... this save editor allows us to mod xbox 360, ps3, and pc. I like to set the platform to start this way i dont forget to do it later while trying to save.

                      In the character tab this is where we edit our characters class, level, op level, save name (what it is named in game not saved as), and customization. For my class ive chosen my favorite class Maya. you can choose who ever you want it doesnt matter. for experience level ths will vary for a few people... If you have the newest lilith sancuatary update then max is 80, if you dont have this but have the digistruct dlc then this will be 72, and If you dont have either of these DLCs it will be 69 (yes haha lol). Alright lets move on to Overpower Level... once again this varies if you put 80 then put 10 here if you put 72 then put 8 here and if you put 69 leave this blank note that if you have chosen to do a lower level person then your max leave this blank as well... I do beleive customization area is self explanitory just play around with them till you find what you like... note that dlc customizations might not work or lead to crashing of game (sanity check) Alright lets head to Vehicle Tab.

                    Same as with the character customization this section you just kind of have to play with it to find what you like... once again be wary of useing items from DLCs you dont own... hovercraft and fan boats are from Scarrlet DLC. continue to the currency tab.

                In the Currecy Tab you can set how much of everything you want. This is simple set these to these values: 
                <br>Cash: 99999999 (8 9s)
                <br>Eridum: 500

                    Gibbbed Codes are codes that allow us to aquirre a certain weapon without going through the hassle of imputting all the weapon parts to match. The link to this website is <a href ="https://imgur.com/user/sparfires/posts"> Here </a>

                        I have already added everything i wish to. (copy the gibbed code and press paste) How you edit you weapon/item level where it says manufactor grade you put 80 for max, 81 for level 80 op 1, 82 for level 80 op 2 so on and so on. now since the lilith update there has seem to been an error with the exploit that say you want to be level 72 op 8 so you would do 80 it will make a level 80 weapon which you cant use

                            once you have eddited your items level you can choose to make it a mastor copy. note you can only make items mastor copies not weapons! at the bottom where is says quantity put 99999999 (8 9s)

                                                   press on weaponrewards and this is as far as i can take you as ive never been good at making hybrid weapons but it is TONS of trial and error and you need weapon parts which i can not find i recall there being a george reborn bl2 gear calculator that had the part IDs but i cannot find it and heard it has been discontinued

                                                       we are going back to the mission playthrough data. I usally leave the first 2 alone in this part but you do you. if you wish to spawn in sanctuary my favorite mission to make active is the rock paper scissors mission. you will also need to make all the missions up to this completed so there are no errors you. you set missions to completed by opening them in mission data and specifing the mission and where it says status put completed. you can find mission codes <a href= "https://www.reddit.com/r/bl2modding/comments/1x9h9h/is_there_a_list_of_all_the_gibbed_mission_names/">here</a>
