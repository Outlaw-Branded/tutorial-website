            <br> Welcome to my modding tutorial website! I plan to advance this website with tons of new games but for now i have incorporated 5 games that i have a decent knowledge of that way im not spending hours on hours researching modding tools whilst also building this site. If there are more games on here at the time of you reading this then I suppose this website was a success. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> <u class= "home_purpose">What is the purpose of this?</u>
            <br> Well, I have always had a passion for modding games and just having fun seeing what i can and cant do. In the prusuit of this i decided to make a youtube channel to share my discoveries where i found a whole community of people who had the same intrests. While i already help tons of people with my youtube and engageing in these communties some people learn differnt and need things broken down more well thats this, It will have pictures, links, and details explanations on just about everything in the modding application. You may now be saying to your self "so you like to ruin the experience for other people?" well the awnser to that is no whenever i mod a game i either play single player or in a server with a fellow modder. Included, when teaching someone to mod i make sure that they know the risks and the pros and cons.
